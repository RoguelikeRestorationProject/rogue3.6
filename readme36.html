<h1 align=center>ROGUE 3.6</h1>

<hr>

<h2>NAME</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>rogue36 &minus; Exploring The Dungeons of Doom</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p><b>rogue36</b> [ <i>save_file</i> ]</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>

	<p align="justify"><u>Rogue</u> is a computer fantasy game with a new twist. It is crt oriented and the object of the game is to survive the attacks of various 
	monsters and get a lot of gold, rather than the puzzle solving orientation
	of most computer fantasy games.</p>

	<p align="justify">To get started you really only need to know two commands. 
	The command ? will give you a list of the available commands and the command /
	will identify the things you see on the screen.</p>

	<p align="justify">To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat 
	other people high scores) you must locate the Amulet of Yendor which is 
	somewhere below the 20th level of the dungeon and get it out. Nobody has 
	achieved this yet and if somebody does, they will probably go down in history
	as a hero among heros.</p>

	<p align="justify">When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, 
	or if you (by some miracle) manage to win, <u>rogue</u> will give you a list of the 
	top-ten scorers. The scoring is based entirely upon how much gold you get.
	There is a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.</p>

	<p align="justify">For more detailed directions, read the document A Guide 
	to the Dungeons of Doom.</p>

screen in reverse video which may or may not cause a core dump.</p>
